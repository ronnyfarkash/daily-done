# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`

**Created**: [DATE]

**Status**: Draft

**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Constitution Alignment *(mandatory)*

- **Scope Boundary**: [Confirm the feature does not require login, accounts,
  backend services, cloud sync, notifications, social features, or gamification
  beyond simple streak/history]
- **Local Data**: [Describe what user data is stored in localStorage, or mark
  NEEDS CLARIFICATION if persistence is unclear]
- **UX Quality**: [Capture mobile-first behavior, accessible labels, keyboard
  usability, empty states, validation errors, and clutter constraints relevant
  to this feature]
- **Approval Gate**: This specification stops for explicit user approval before
  planning begins.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.

  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., "Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value]"]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "allow users to mark today's item done"]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [validation behavior, e.g., "prevent saving an empty item label"]
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., "view recent completion history"]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [local data requirement, e.g., "persist completion state in localStorage"]
- **FR-005**: System MUST [UX behavior, e.g., "show an empty state before any daily item exists"]

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*

- **FR-006**: System MUST calculate streaks using [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: date boundary not specified - browser local date or another explicit rule?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST preserve local history for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "Users can mark today done in under 10 seconds from first load"]
- **SC-002**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "The primary flow is usable at 360px viewport width without horizontal scrolling"]
- **SC-003**: [User success metric, e.g., "Users can understand the empty state and create the first item without help text outside the UI"]
- **SC-004**: [Quality metric, e.g., "Playwright verifies the critical flow without console errors"]

## Assumptions

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right assumptions based on reasonable defaults
  chosen when the feature description did not specify certain details.
-->

- [Assumption about target users, e.g., "A single person uses the app in one browser profile"]
- [Assumption about scope boundaries, e.g., "No login, backend, cloud sync, or notifications are part of this feature"]
- [Assumption about data/environment, e.g., "The browser supports localStorage"]
- [Dependency on existing system/service, e.g., "No external service dependency is required"]
